# MicMuter
Script to provide hardware on/off functionality for any attached microphone
Works perfectly with keeping your mic away from nasty system mic services using the svchost audio bridge that does not respect the volume mute provided by traditional mic mute programs

ONLY FOR 64bit WINDOWS

For automatic startup, make sure there is a link to the MicMuter.ahk/exe file in run->shell:startup.

Toggles the default mic, press F6 to mute/unmute
